5. Please provide a brief description of what your project does and how to use the application. Make sure to include any required information like a username and password.
This project is the beginning of an online media player. The project consists of querying songs and their album information and playlists created by the
user. To use it all you need to do is select the playlist you want to work with, get the data, and select the songs you want to add or remove.

6. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.

I had a really hard time getting the stuff to look pretty. I spent a very long time (10+ hrs) working on the look of everything but I feel like it 
is not very good. Something that does work the way I want it to, but could be seen as a bug is duplicate songs in a playlist.
I personally like adding certain songs multiple times as it increases the chance it will play when the playlist is on shuffle.
